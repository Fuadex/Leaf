// The bluetooth module functioning logic is created based on Prof. Takaya's blog: http://prof-takaya.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/connecting-android-and-arduino-by.html
// However, the logic was changed radically, so that it worked beyond booleans and so that I could send any information between Processing and Arduino
// Despite having referenced Prof. Takaya's blog on multiple occassions, it must be stated at this point, that the Prof. has used Ketai library
// Therefore all the logic is based on the library and therefore we treated his code as a reference code for running Bluetooth
// The reference code does nothing beyond launching Arduino's LED and printing information, as it whether it is on or off
// We managed to send integers back and forth via a selection of variable transformations

//The StopWatchTimer is a class built on java and created by a user name

//The Music library was found on a Processing Discussion Board, parts of the code was appropriated from a user named kfrajer
