Just a quick readme:

There is a Fritzing diagram to show how the entire system worked, use either the Fritzing file (.fzz) or check out the .png

In case of code, it's split into two folders:
- Leaf (Android Processing App)
- Leaf (Arduino code)

I did end up using a variety of libraries, especially for the Processing part into which most work landed up on.
Main problem was primarily the bluetooth connectivity with a hacked bluetooth module for Arduino but once I cracked that, I could get lots executed.
The other issue was the music playing library, which would frequently just bug out. It worked fine for the purpose of our prototypes, though.
